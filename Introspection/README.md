1.For the first question I don't why you have to choose me but I am passionate in coding and I tried hard for completing this tasks as I am a student fron non CSE background I tried to complete my tasks by learning coding and trying to generate ideas but I learned one thing by doing tasks that's managing my college stuff and tasks It really helped me to build myself and also interacting with other's too I was a shy person before . I tried my level best to complete the tasks and from first I wanted to join the club 
2.Actually for now I want to learn coding to more extent and be like a professional in coding 
3.Taking inspiration from our mentors who all have been an helping hand to us and didn't care the time we DM them they were very active and helped us in clarifying the doubt's as early as possible I would like to help my juniour club member's in the same way and contribute as much as I can to the club..
